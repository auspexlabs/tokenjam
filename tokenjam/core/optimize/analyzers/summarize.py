"""
Summarize analyzer — surfaces static prompt files worth summarizing (Track A).

Unlike the other analyzers, this one reasons over the **filesystem**, not
telemetry: it runs the read-only, catalog-default summarize scan
(`core/summarize/candidates.list_candidates`) and reports the per-call
prompt-token reduction available by summarizing those files' prose. It carries
the #111 recoverable-savings contract so the Overview waste band and the
`/cost/components` overlay pick it up with no UI change (registry-driven).

Honesty discipline (Critical Rule 14 + `core/summarize/estimate.py`): the figure
we can stand behind from a file alone is **tokens**. A per-call dollar amount at
default rates is noise, and the meaningful *amortized* dollar needs a real
per-file call count (telemetry) we don't have — so `estimated_recoverable_usd`
is left `None` (the contract's "no estimate available for this state"), and the
usage-ranked/amortized path is deferred. Every user-visible string says
"estimated" / "review before applying" — never "saves you".
